#Use the each method of Array to iterate over [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], and print out each value.
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

arr.each do |number|
  puts number
end

#Same as above, but only print out values greater than 5.


arr.each do |number|
  if number >5
    puts number

#Now, using the same array from #2, use the select method to extract all odd numbers into a new array.

#Append 11 to the end of the original array. Prepend 0 to the beginning.

#What's the major difference between an Array and a Hash?

#a hash contains key value pairs elements while an array is a simple list of elements


#Create a Hash, with one key-value pair, using both Ruby syntax styles.

p hash1 = { :a => 1}
p hash2 = {a: 1}


#Suppose you have a 

 h = {a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4}

#1. Get the value of key `:b`.
h[:b]

#2. Add to this hash the key:value pair `{e:5}`
h[:e] = 5

#3. Remove all key:value pairs whose value is less than 3.5
h.delete_if {|key, value| value < 3.5}

#Can hash values be arrays? Can you have an array of hashes? (give examples)

 p hashhh = { ok:[1,2,3], ko:[1,2,3]}

 p arrhash = [{ok:[1,2,3]}, {ko:[1,2,3]}]


#Given the following data structures. Write a program that copies the information from the array into the empty hash that applies to the correct person.

contact_data = [["joe@email.com", "123 Main st.", "555-123-4567"],
            ["sally@email.com", "404 Not Found Dr.", "123-234-3454"]]

contacts = {"Joe Smith" => {}, "Sally Johnson" => {}}

contacts["Joe Smith"][:email] = contact_data[0][0]
contacts["Joe Smith"][:adress] = contact_data[0][1]
contacts["Joe Smith"][:phone] = contact_data[0][2]

contacts["Sally Johnson"][:email] = contact_data[1][0]
contacts["Sally Johnson"][:adress] = contact_data[1][1]
contacts["Sally Johnson"][:phone] = contact_data[1][2]

p contacts

# Expected output:
#  {
#    "Joe Smith"=>{:email=>"joe@email.com", :address=>"123 Main st.", :phone=>"555-123-4567"},
#    "Sally Johnson"=>{:email=>"sally@email.com", :address=>"404 Not Found Dr.",  :phone=>"123-234-3454"}
#  }


#Using the hash you created from the previous exercise, demonstrate how you would access Joe's email and Sally's phone number?

p contacts["Joe Smith"][:email]
p contacts["Sally Johnson"][:phone]


#Use Ruby's Array method delete_if and String method start_with? to delete all of the words that begin with an "s" in the following array.
#Then recreate the arr and get rid of all of the words that start with "s" or starts with "w".

startarr = ['snow', 'winter', 'ice', 'slippery', 'salted roads', 'white trees']

startarr.delete_if {|word| word.start_with?("s", "w") }   

#and turn it into a new array that consists of strings containing one word. (ex. ["white snow", etc...] â†’ ["white", "snow", etc...]. Look into using Array's map and flatten methods, as well as String's split method.



a = ['white snow', 'winter wonderland', 'melting ice',
     'slippery sidewalk', 'salted roads', 'white trees']

a = a.map {|word| word.split}

p a = a.flatten


#What will the following program output?

hash1 = {shoes: "nike", "hat" => "adidas", :hoodie => true}
hash2 = {"hat" => "adidas", :shoes => "nike", hoodie: true}
